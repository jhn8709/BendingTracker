# BendingTracker

This program tracks the bending angle of a robot using Python and OpenCV. Currently it uses stickers attached to the base and
tip of the tail (our robot is based on a pangolin's tail). To use this program, you should connect a camera to your computer and
then choose the camera in the code (currently it uses the second connected camera. Also, the code is designed to communicate to an Arduino 
and if you do not need this, comment out that section.
